this is a repository about input saturation and delay system research.
I will concentrate on three type of no-linear system.
* $\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B\sigma(Fx(t))$
* $\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+BFx(t-\tau)$
* $\dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+B\sigma(Fx(t-\tau))$

for more details,it's on the [mark.md](mark.md).
I have finished the first 2 type of no-linear system via Krasovskii Function and Razumihkin Function.
The last one is still remain to be solved.
